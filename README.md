# ContrerasJGreaterThanLessThanAPI
This challenge the user is inputing two numbers in postman to see if the one number is greater than, less than or equal to the other number.

First the will push F5 so that is debugs the code and makes sure the code is running, they will then get the local host url and paste it into postman so that the dated is being transferred to postman.
        Local Host                  Controller      Route
Example: https://localhost:7228/GreaterThanLessThan/greatorless

Peer reviewed by: Griffin Parker - The code looks and runs great!! I'm not sure what models are, but they are obviously working in the program
Now I have something to look in to when I'm at home today. Great job!!
